				Due to popular demand, here is a quick overview of what I have in my camera bag including my camera bodies, lenses and flash ðŸ™‚

			<p>The second is my Canon Rebel t5i, crop sensor camera that has served me so well over the past few years. The biggest reason I moved on to full frame was to increase the quality and range of my images. the more I learned to use my t5i, the bigger my artistic vision got, so I needed an upgrade to keep up with that vision. The first image is my Canon 5D Mark III which I've only had for half a year and it has absolutely blown my mind. I never knew low-lighting could be handled so effortlessly</p>

			<p>The three lenses I own are the Canon 85mm f/1.8, 18-55mm kit lens and 75-300mm telephoto lens. I honestly do entire shoots with the 85mm, just because its performance is so reliable. Since it's a prime lens it doesn't zoom in or out, and I don't really notice it as a hinderance, but if i'm shooting in a huge crowd I might sometimes switch to the 70-300. After I bought the 85mm I have also not really used the kit lens with my t5i, if I did, it was mostly to cover a wide shot of a hall or to show the magnitude of attendees at an event because the 80mm and 75mm bring me too close to the subjects to cover enough width. The next lens I will definitley buy some time in the near future is a 50mm (well known as the nifty fifty) just for the range of shots I can take with it, with the 85-75 minimun range that I have right now, I am mostly limited to portrait shots.</p>

			<p>The last piece of hardware in my camera bag is the 600EX-RT flash, and honestly speaking I got this flash very recently on a great deal, but I have yet to figure out how to use it fully. I found it extremely useful for stage events, I found that I was able to capture movement much better and it obviously reduced the graininess of stage shots when the lighting given was less than usable, but I'll make sure to do a full review once I get the hang of using this ðŸ˜€ </p>

			<p>And there you go! that's a list of everything I use to take pictures. If you want to look at more samples of my photography make sure to check out my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/aarthiganeshphotography">facebook page</a> ðŸ™‚ </p>
